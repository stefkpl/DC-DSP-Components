The Winamp2 Visual Plugins Form. If you worked with them before, you should know what to do here. 
The first Time the Filter runs, it tries to retrieve the Plugins Directory from the Registry. This works 
only if you have Winamp installed. Otherwise you have to choose the Plugins Directory manually. 
The Interval <b style="color:#FF0000;">(1)</b> specifys how often the Filter will push Data to the Plugin. This shouldn't 
be set too low. A value of 40ms is actually enough. Autostart <b style="color:#FF0000;">(2)</b> will start the last chosen
Visual Plugin automatically the next time the Filter is created. The Red Cross <b style="color:#FF0000;">(3)</b> will remove
the Plugin List. This will increase the loading Time of the Filter a bit.<br><br>
A small Note: I <b>am</b> aware that not every Plugin is working within this Filter. Some Plugins are 
searching for the Winamp Window (that doesn't exist), others don't like the Threaded creation ...<br>
If a Plugin isn't working, too bad ... try contacting the Author if he is going to make it usable 
within DirectShow Applications.
