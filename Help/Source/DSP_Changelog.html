<li>The Pre Amplify, Equalizer, Phase Invert, True Bass, Low Pass and High Pass Filters has been extended to do the DSP seperate on each Channel</li>
<li>The TrayIcon has been removed, since it´s much more complicated now (because of the seperate DSP) to Control the Filter through the TrayIcon. Also WMP9 doesn´t seem to like it</li>

<li>Bitmap Alpha Blend, which is used on the EQ Property Page is now MMX Optimized</li>
