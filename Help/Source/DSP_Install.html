IMPORTANT: If you already have an older Version installed, uninstall it first and <br>
remove all of the DC-DSP Components related .bpl and .dcp files from your <br>
"Delphi7\PRojects\Source\" directory. Otherwise you might Crash Delphi.<br>
<ol>
<li>
As first you need to add a few Directorys to your Searchpath in Delphi.<br>
These are:<br><br>
<i>
\dcdspfilter\DSP Components<br>
\dcdspfilter\DSPack Filter<br>
\dcdspfilter\MoveLibrary<br>
\dcdspfilter\Plugin API\API
</i>
</li><br><br>
<li>
Now you must execute the Package Installers.<br>
Delphi will raise an exception about that it´s not able to find Resource Files.<br>
Ignore them, because Delphi will recreate them anyway.<br><br>

<b>For Delphi 6 use:</b><br>
As first open<br>
<i>\dcdspfilter\DSP Components\DCDSPComponents_D6.dpk</i><br>
hit Compile and Install.<br><br>

Now open<br>
<i>\dcdspfilter\DSPack Filter\DSPackDCDSPFilter_D6.dpk</i><br>
hit Compile and Install.<br><br>

Now open<br>
<i>\dcdspfilter\Plugin API\API\DCPluginRenderer_D6.dpk</i><br>
hit Compile and Install.<br><br>

<b>For Delphi 7 use:</b><br>
As first open<br>
<i>\dcdspfilter\DSP Components\DCDSPComponents_D7.dpk</i><br>
hit Compile and Install.<br><br>

Now open<br>
<i>\dcdspfilter\DSPack Filter\DSPackDCDSPFilter_D7.dpk</i><br>
hit Compile and Install.<br><br>

Now open<br>
<i>\dcdspfilter\Plugin API\API\DCPluginRenderer_D7.dpk</i><br>
hit Compile and Install.
</li><br><br>
<li>
Now you are ready to compile the Sample Applications.<br><br>

<i>\dcdspfilter\Samples\DirectShow\</i><br>
contains a Sample how to control the DC-DSP DirectShow Filter.<br><br>

<i>\dcdspfilter\Samples\DSPack\</i><br>
contains the Sample that uses the DSPack Filter Component and the DSP Components.<br><br>

<i>\dcdspfilter\Samples\DSPack DVDPlay\</i><br>
contains only a Sample how to add the DSPack Filter to a DVD Graph. <br><br>

<i>\dcdspfilter\Plugin API\Samples\</i><br>
contains Sample Applications and Plugins that shows how to implement DSP and Visual Plugins in any Application.<br>
</li>
</ol>
<br><br>
<b>  some last Informations ...</b><br>
All the DSPack Samples won´t need to have DCDSPFilter.ax registered to your System, <br>
while all DirectShow Samples need it. The Source of DCDSPFilter.ax is located in <br>
<i>\dcdspfilter\DirectShow Filter\Source</i> After compiling it is placed in 
<i>\dcdspfilter\DirectShow Filter\Binary</i><br>
To register it run registar.bat. To unregister it run unregister.bat<br>
<br><br>
<b>Important !!!</b><br>
It is important to add RecyclerMM.pas and FastMove.pas as first units to your project's .dpk file !!!<br>
Otherwise your Application/DLL may crash with certain DSP's !!!<br>
RecyclerMM is GPL'ed, so in case you´re using my Components within an commercial Application, <br>
you´re not allowed to use RecyclerMM. In that case open dspUtils.pas and comment {$DEFINE USE_SSE}.<br>
DON'T compile the Package with RecyclerMM. Delphi doesn't seem to like that.
