This File is ment to be an Quick Installation Guide to install all the Packages.

-DSP Components
 This is a set of DSP Components that can do various DSP Transformations on Audio Data.
 It also conntains Wrappers for MS DMO Filters. Note that DMOs are limited to 8/16 Bit PCM 
 and 32 Bit Float with 1 or 2 Channels. To compile it you will need the DirecX9 Components 
 from DSPack 2.31 or higher. Get it at www.progdigy.com.

-MoveLibrary
 This Directory contains some MMX/SSE optimized CopyMemory/MoveMemory/Move instructions and 
 a fast Memory Manager Replacement. (C) FastCode Project.

-Plugin API
 This Directory contains sample Applications and Renderer that can be used to extend an 
 Application with a DSP and Visualasation API.

-DSPack Filter
 This Directory contains the Directshow Filter that can only be used within the DSPack
 Components. Get the DSPack Components at www.progdigy.com
 For now (16. May 2004) it is strictly needed that you use the CVS BaseClasses. 
 They are available here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/dspack


IMPORTANT: If you already have an older Version installed, uninstall it first and 
remove all of the DC-DSP Components related .bpl and .dcp files from your 
"Delphi7\PRojects\Source\" directory. Otherwise you might Crash Delphi.


1)
As first you need to add a few Directorys to your Searchpath in Delphi. These are:

\dcdspfilter\DSP Components
\dcdspfilter\DSPack Filter
\dcdspfilter\MoveLibrary
\dcdspfilter\Plugin API\API

2)
Now you must execute the Package Installers. 
Delphi will raise an exception about that it´s not able to find Resource Files. 
Ignore them, because Delphi will recreate them anyway.

For Delphi 6 use:
As first open
\dcdspfilter\DSP Components\DCDSPComponents_D6.dpk
hit Compile and Install.

Now open 
\dcdspfilter\DSPack Filter\DSPackDCDSPFilter_D6.dpk
hit Compile and Install.

Now open
\dcdspfilter\Plugin API\API\DCPluginRenderer_D6.dpk
hit Compile and Install.

For Delphi 7 use:
As first open
\dcdspfilter\DSP Components\DCDSPComponents_D7.dpk
hit Compile and Install.

Now open 
\dcdspfilter\DSPack Filter\DSPackDCDSPFilter_D7.dpk
hit Compile and Install.

Now open
\dcdspfilter\Plugin API\API\DCPluginRenderer_D7.dpk
hit Compile and Install.

3)
Now you are ready to compile the Sample Applications.

\dcdspfilter\Samples\DirectShow\
will contain a Sample how to control the Dc-DSP DirectShow Filter. It´s not ready yet.

\dcdspfilter\Samples\DSPack\ 
contains the Sample that uses the DSPack Filter Component and the DSP Components. 

\dcdspfilter\Samples\DSPack DVDPlay\
contains only a Sample how to add the DSPack Filter to a DVD Graph. 

\dcdspfilter\Plugin API\Samples\
contains Sample Applications and Plugins that shows how to implement DSP and Visual Plugins in any Application.

4)
some last Informations.

All the DSPack Samples won´t need to have DCDSPFilter.ax registered to your System, while
all DirectShow Samples need it. 
The Source of DCDSPFilter.ax is located in 
\dcdspfilter\DirectShow Filter\Source
After compiling it is placed in 
\dcdspfilter\DirectShow Filter\Binary
To register it run registar.bat. To unregister it run unregister.bat

Important !!!
It is important to add FastMM4.pas and FastMove.pas as first units to your project's .dpk file !!!
Otherwise your Application/DLL may crash with certain DSP's where 16byte aligned Memory is needed !!!
