[known Issues]
-it´s needed setup the FPU to Double Precision when using dmoI3DL2Reverb. The Filter sets the mode automatically to  double when created, initialiazed and processed.
-The Property Pages sometimes doesn't get repainted. That´s caused by Borlands TForm implementation.
 To repaint them it´s needed to minimize the Window and then restore it.
-Accessing the PropertyPage from the TrayIcon freezes the App when closing the File. Solution: Make sure the Property PAge is closed before the next File is rendered.

-small redesign of DMO Components.
-fixed 8 Bit processing Bug.
-fixed Equalizer Bug.
-added Delphi 6 Packages.
-fixed another Bug with dmoDistortion when retrieving Values.
-improved dspPitchScale Code. Uses now a Windowing Table instead of calculating it all the Time.
-included CPU measauring to the Visual Buffering in the DirectShow Filter.
-Added prefered Language Detection to Matroska Stream Switching.
-Switching with different MediaTypes even when reconnecting the Output Pin is now supported.
-The DirectShow Filter can be limited to only one Instance per Graph. This is enabled as default and can be disabled on the Proprety Page.
-Added Matroska and Ogg Language detection to Stream Switching.
-The DirectShow Filter won´t connect to the MMSwitch Input Pin anymore. It sux to have a lot of instances of the filter. Right now, the Filter connects after the Switcher only.
-Fixed an Winamp Directory Issue on the Property Pages.
-implemented Multiple Input Pins with Simple Stream Switching on the DirectShow Filter. (disabled as default)
-fixed a Bug with DTS/AC3 bypass.
-replaced DoubleClick with SingleClick in the DSP Selection Property Page.
-Added a Threaded and non Threaded Version of the Winamp2 DSP Wrapper.
-fixed an crash with Winamp Plugins on the DirectShow Filter when created Threaded. (crashed Zoomplayer and RadLight when switching Plugins)
-added CPU Usage Dialog to the DirectShow Filter. It shows the DSP,DMO and Winamp DSP CPU Usage.
-fixed a Major issue in dspFastFourier.
-improved dspFastFourier on Athlon-XP CPUs (SSE capable CPUs)
-reduced the Memory Usage for the dspEqualizer Filter.
-Bugfixed the not showing labels on the DirectShow Filter Property Page where a ScrollBox is used.
-DirectShow filter has now a Dynamic Filter List which allows adding only (and as much as) Filters that are needed.
-DirectShow Filter supports now the DX9 DMO Audio Effects.
-replaced the Winamp Visual Timer in the DrectShow Filter with a Threaded Version. Caused RadLight4 (A6) to crash with the VCL TTimer.
-Added a new Treble Enhancer DSP Filter to the Component Pack.
-Filters and DSP Components uses now SSE/MMX Optimized MemMoves through MoveLibrary (C)FastCode Project
-Added Quality and FFTSize to the PitchScale Propertypage of th eDirectShow Filter.
-Updated the NSIS Installer Script.
-Fixed a Bug on the Phaser PropertyPAge which caused the Values to Reset.
-DirectShow Filter is now seperate from the DSPack Filter
-Removed "Disable optimized FFT" from DirectShow Filter, since it´s working stable on all CPUs.
-Filters are now TransInPlace again. This fixes some issues wth connecting 3rd party Filters.
-DirectShow Filter contains now only one Class with "MERIT_PREFERED +2" Merit. Normal Version has been removed.
-Equalizer has now a much better Quality and Bandwidth (2048 Point FFT)
-Every DSP Filter has it´s own Component
-Added DMO Wrappers and a bunch of new Filters to the Delphi Tab.
-Winamp2 Visual and DSP Plugins has their own component.
-Spectrum and Waveform Analyzer has their own component.
-DirectShow  Filter uses now the DSP Component Classes.
-DSPack Filter doesn´t need any external Filter (binary)
-Filter allows SPDIF and DTS connection, but no DSP/Visual Buffering is done (added this for Dynamic reconnect with AC3Filter and SPDIF)
-added an INF Installer for the Binary (thx to BlackTrip)
-DirectShow Filter Spectrum on the EQ Prop.Page uses now the Spectrum Class.
-rewritten the Plugin API. Can be used within any Filter that exports a Callback for PCM Data (DSP Plugins) and implements the VisualInterface (VIS Plugins).
-Added Mediatype Compare on the Buffer Initialization to prevent unused Memory Allocations.
-No Delphi 5 Support anymore. (there´s way too much Code that need to be converted)
-Added Audiostream delay through timestamp changing for DSPack and DirectShow Filter.
-removed Echo/Delay Filter from DirectShow Filter. (Uses too much memory and changing the Delay with Timestamps works better).
-Added AttackDB and Release Time to Dynamic Amplify. Thus it´s possible to set the Amplification more precise.
-Equalizer in DirectShow Filter reduced from +/-20db to +/- 12db.
-Registry Settings for the DirectShow Filter are stored now in HKEY_CURRENT_USER
